## Main Features

* View a list of buses with status and capacity.
* Create a new bus.
* Edit or delete existing buses.
* Frontend-backend interaction via REST API with token authentication.

---

## Why These Technologies

* **Laravel**: Fast to set up, secure, and ideal for building REST APIs.
* **React**: Dynamic, modular UI, easy to maintain and scale.
* **TypeScript**: Static typing reduces runtime errors.
* **Custom CSS**: Complete control over design, lightweight, and easy to modify.

## Notes

* Authentication token for API calls must be added in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

* The project structure allows separate development of frontend and backend while keeping a single repository.
